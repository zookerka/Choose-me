# Choose Me is the project where developers can express themselves in the most effective way, and the project where HR's can find any worker that they need (in IT realm) Its main feature is a 'Card System,' which we found to be the most efficient way to create compact CVs showcasing achievements and skills. It also makes finding developers through specific tags much easier

This is basic back-end version without finished notifications and chats and some optimization issues. Unfortunately, this project hasn't been successful so far, which is why it may seem incomplete and why the backend is still a work in progress. However, I plan to complete the server with basic frontend to give it a more polished and professional appearance.

Here some basic info about this project:

1. Main framework here NestJS

2. A gateway-based approach is used to implement chats

3. For DB I've chosen PostgreSQL since it is most convenient and the best choice for this project (Prisma as ORM)

4. I planned to migrate from github to gitlab for CI/CD inegrtion (which I will do btw)

5. Sentry implemented here as common error handler

6. I use here Access and Refresh Token system for auth system

I'm not planning to monetize this project or smth, but pollish it. Maybe just 4fun I will even glue AI here.
